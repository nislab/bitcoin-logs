The directory contains log files for experiments regarding additional full transactions in the compact block relay protocol. The directory structure is as follows.

Folder | Content
---|---
[`ao`](https://github.com/nislab/bitcoin-logs/tree/wip/at/ao) | Experimental logs for nodes in the `always on` regime
[`sc`](https://github.com/nislab/bitcoin-logs/tree/wip/at/sc) | Experimental logs for nodes in the `statistical churn` regime

Each subdirectory contains different folders for each experimental node in the respective network regime. The content within each folder is described as follows.

Item | Content
-|-
`cmpctblkaddtxn` | List of transaction hashes for each full additional transaction for every compact block received by the experimental node
`getblocktxn` | List of transaction indices which were missing when a compact block was received and were requested from peers
`mempool` | Snapshot of mempool (i.e., list of hashes of transactions in the mempool) just before compact blocks were received from peers
`logNode_root.txt` | Log file generated by the log-to-file system containing a detailed log of received blocks, headers, and other events
