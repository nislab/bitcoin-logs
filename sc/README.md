The directory contains log files for experimental nodes in the `statistical churn` regime. The directory structure is as follows.

Folder | Content
---|---
C | Experimental logs for nodes configured with the compact block relay protocol
G | Experimental logs for nodes configured with the Graphene block relay protocol
N | Experimental logs for nodes configured with the normal (default) block relay protocol

Each subdirectory contains log files for separate nodes configured with the respective block relay protocol.
